# IP Packages

This folder contains RISC-V IP packages that can be imported into the Libero IP Catalog. Importing these IP packages will allow adding a RISC-V processor into your FPGA design by selecting the processor of your choice from the IP Catalog in Libero.

## Importing an IP package into Libero

IP packages are imported into Libero using the File->Import->Others menu item and selecting a .cpz IP package file. For example importing the Microsemi_MiV_MIV_RV32IMAF_L1_AHB_2.0.100.cpz file will result in the MIV_RV32IMAF_L1_AHB_2.0.100 becoming availalbe from the processors section of the Libero IP Catalog.
